## 🚀 Featured Projects
**[Cacaio – Cell Line Similarity Pipeline](https://github.com/CaioMussatto/Cacaio)**  
End-to-end Python pipeline for single-cell RNA-seq analysis comparing CCLE cancer cell lines with primary tumors. Processes 11 datasets (>250K cells) using Scanpy, computes similarity metrics, and delivers results through an interactive Streamlit dashboard for biological exploration.

**[Cacaio-Docker – Cloud Deployment](https://github.com/CaioMussatto/Cacaio-docker)**  
Production-ready containerization of the Cacaio pipeline deployed on Google Cloud Platform. Implements Docker orchestration, CI/CD workflows, and scalable cloud architecture for reproducible bioinformatics applications.

**[LatexIA – PDF Layout Reconstruction](https://github.com/CaioMussatto/LatexIA)**  
Machine learning system that converts PDF documents into structured LaTeX code. Features a cloud-native pipeline with Random Forest classification, Supabase backend, and ARM64 Docker containers for efficient document processing.

**[Bioinfo-Seeker Pro – Job Automation](https://github.com/CaioMussatto/Bioinfo-Seeker-Pro)**  
Intelligent job search automation platform for Bioinformatics roles. Aggregates listings from LinkedIn, Indeed, and Google using web scraping, applies keyword filtering (Python/R/Biology terms), and presents curated opportunities through a modern Flask dashboard with PostgreSQL backend.
